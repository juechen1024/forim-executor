   Response:
   Status: 404 Not Found
   Server: nginx/1.21.3
   Content-Type: text/html
   Body: standard nginx 404 HTML page

2) POST http://192.168.7.2:31380/inner/schedule/get/asynchronous/job/list
   Payload (jobStatus=0): same as above but "jobStatus": "0"

   Response:
   Status: 404 Not Found
   Server: nginx/1.21.3
   Content-Type: text/html
   Body: standard nginx 404 HTML page

Notes and recommendations for ops/maintainers:
- The host and port are reachable (HEAD / returned 200 earlier), but the specific API path returned 404 from nginx.
- Likely causes:
  - Service is deployed under a different path prefix (e.g. /api, /forim, /gateway). Check nginx config for proxy_pass and location blocks.
  - The schedule service might be hosted on a different internal port or virtual host. Confirm upstream mapping for requests to /inner/schedule/*.
  - The upstream service may expect a different HTTP method or additional headers; however, returning an HTML 404 typically means the location is not found rather than a payload/validation error.

Reproduction commands (PowerShell):
$env:PYTHONPATH = 'src/main/python'
$env:FORIM_INNER_SCHEDULE_URL = 'http://192.168.7.2:31380'
python tools/debug_schedule_request.py

If you want me to probe common alternate prefixes (e.g. /api/inner/schedule/..., /forim/inner/...), I can run a safe read-only probe and list which endpoints return 200/JSON vs 404. Please confirm and I will proceed.
